# SWCME semi-analytical solar-wind / CME-shock model

SWCME provides lightweight 1-D and 3-D solar-wind/CME-shock backgrounds for
energetic-particle transport studies.  The 3-D model combines a Parker magnetic
field, Leblanc density profile, analytical CME/shock kinematics, configurable
shock geometry, and phenomenological sheath/ejecta fields.

## Current 3-D shock geometries

`swcme3d::ShockShape` currently provides:

- `Sphere` — a Sun-centered spherical verification geometry;
- `Ellipsoid` — a Sun-centered ellipsoid whose three axes scale self-similarly
  with the shock apex distance; and
- `SSE` — the recommended finite self-similar-expansion spherical cap.

`ConeSSE` is retained as an enum alias for source compatibility but now has the
same corrected semantics as `SSE`.  It no longer means the old
`R=R_apex*cos(theta)^m` cosine-cap model.  The legacy `flank_slowdown_m`
parameter is retained in `Params` only so existing source/input code continues
to compile; it is ignored for the corrected SSE geometry.

### Finite SSE geometry

For apex distance `R_apex` and half width `lambda`, the generating sphere is

```text
c = R_apex / (1 + sin(lambda))
a = c sin(lambda),
```

where `c` is the heliocentric distance of the sphere center along the CME axis
and `a` is its radius.  A ray separated by `alpha` from the CME axis intersects
the outward cap at

```text
R(alpha) = c cos(alpha) + sqrt(a^2 - c^2 sin(alpha)^2)
```

for `alpha <= lambda`.  The ray is tangent at `alpha=lambda`; no surface exists
for larger angular separation.  The exact outward normal is

```text
n_hat = (R e_r - c e_CME) / a.
```

`Model::shape_radius_normal()` returns a boolean surface-existence flag.  When
it returns `false`, the radius and normal outputs are zero and are not physical
values.  `Model::diagnose_direction()` follows the same convention and returns
`rc=1`, `V_sh,n=0` for an absent finite surface.  The Cartesian evaluators use
this flag internally and return the undisturbed ambient wind/Parker field
outside the SSE angular support.

### Self-similar flank speed

All supported shapes use the same geometric normal-speed relation.  If the
shape scales with apex distance so that `R(u,t)=f(u) R_apex(t)`, then

```text
dR/dt   = V_apex R/R_apex
V_sh,n  = V_apex (R/R_apex) (e_r dot n_hat).
```

This replaces the legacy independent cosine flank-speed factor and corrects the
ellipsoid flank speed, which previously used the full apex speed away from the
apex.

## Validation

Build the validation executable from `test/`:

```sh
cd test
make
./output/test_swcme --list
./output/test_swcme --all
```

The finite shock geometry is covered by `GEO01`-`GEO08` in
`test/3d/test_geometry.cpp`.  See `test/README.md` for detailed test purposes,
reference calculations, and acceptance criteria.

## Scope of the current geometry update

The geometry correction deliberately does not change the current shock
compression proxy, downstream Rankine-Hugoniot state, DBM slow/zero-drag
behavior, sheath/ejecta model, or shock-mesh apex/seam topology.  Those are
separate remediation items and should be changed only together with their own
validation tests.
