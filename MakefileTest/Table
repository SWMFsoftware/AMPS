Table of all nightly AMPS tests.

Format:
Name=<APP>       (machines) - name of the test;                       required
Keys=<APPKEYS>   (machines) - keys specific for <APP>;                optional
Outs=<APPOUTFILE>(machines) - output files for <APP>, SPACE-separated;optional

Machines can be defined:
 absent              - the same for all machines
 0+`hostname -s`+... - only for machines listed
  -`hostname -s`-... - except for machines listed.

Within one block "Name=" can be used ONLY ONCE!
"Keys=" and "Outs=" may be repeated, e.g.
	Keys=-key1(0+machine1)
	Keys=-key2(-machine1)
thus "-key1" is used only on machine1 and "-key2" is used on all other.

If Keys is absent or empty, no keys are used.

If Outs is absent or empty, file naming test_<APP> is used.
