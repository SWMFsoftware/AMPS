# srcEarth validation tests

This directory contains executable regression/validation tests for the AMPS
Earth SEP/geospace backward products.  Each test is stored in its own directory
(`C1`, `C2`, ..., `F1`, `F2`, ...).  Test scripts are intended to be executed
from the directory containing the `amps` executable, not from inside the test
subdirectory.

Common convention:

```bash
python srcEarth/test/<TEST_ID>/run_<TEST_ID>.py -np 4 -nt 16
```

where `-np` is the number of MPI ranks passed to `mpirun` and `-nt` is the number
of threads per MPI rank.  Defaults are `-np 4` and `-nt 16`.

## C1 — Pure dipole vertical Størmer cutoff

C1 compares the numerical vertical cutoff rigidity with the analytical Størmer
formula in a centered aligned dipole.  It can be run in either Mode3D or gridless
mode:

```bash
python srcEarth/test/C1/run_C1.py --mode 3d --mode3d-field-eval ANALYTIC
python srcEarth/test/C1/run_C1.py --mode 3d --mode3d-field-eval MESH
python srcEarth/test/C1/run_C1.py --mode gridless
```

The Mode3D `--mode3d-field-eval ANALYTIC` option passes
`-mode3d-field-eval ANALYTIC` to AMPS.  It is useful for separating the pusher and
classifier from mesh interpolation error.  `--mode3d-field-eval MESH` exercises
the full mesh-backed Mode3D field path.


### Parser-compatible inputs

C1 input templates follow the CCMC/RoR-style `AMPS_PARAM_test.in` layout that is
known to pass the current parser.  The test harness passes newer validation
controls through the AMPS command line instead of placing them as active input
keywords.  This avoids parser failures in code checkouts where the CLI support is
newer than the input-file parser.
