\chapter{List of input commands}

Input commands are set in logical blocks, which are
marked by lines \texttt{\#NAME} - beginning of 
a block {\bf NAME} - and \texttt{\#endNAME} - end
of that block. Input commands are listed below 
sorted by blocks.

\section{MAIN}

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf SpeciesList}

Definition of the species used in the simulation, names of the species should
be the same as they are used in the source code. \\
{\tt SpeciesList=Na,H,O2PLUS,O\_THERMAL}

\item {\bf makefile}

Introduces changes in the Makefile.\\
{\tt makefile MPIRUN=mpirun -np 16}\\
{\tt makefile SPICE=/Users/MyUser/MySpiceFolder}

\item {\bf ForceRepeatableSimulationPath}

\item {\bf DebuggerMode}

Switches ON/OFF debugger mode of execution

\item {\bf CouplerMode}

Defines the mode of coupler execution, three are available:
\\{\tt CouplerMode=off} - no coupling, 
\\{\tt CouplerMode=swmf} - coupling within SWMF, 
\\{\tt CouplerMode=ices} - coupling using ICES tool.

\item {\bf SourceDirectory}

The directory where the main source code is located, usually it is
{\tt src} folder.\\
{\tt SourceDirectory=src}

\item {\bf ProjectSourceDirectory}

The directory where the source code for particular project is located.\\
{\tt ProjectSourceDirectory=srcEuropa}

\item {\bf WorkingSourceDirectory}

The directory where the code will be assembled and compiled
(choose the one that doesn't exist in the repository in order
to avoid deletion of source code files!)\\
{\tt WorkingSourceDirectory=srcTemp}

\item {\bf TrajectoryIntersectionWithBlockFaces}

\item {\bf StdOutErrorLog}

\item {\bf TimeStepMode}

Defines the way the time step is performed, four are available:
\\{\tt TimeStepMode=SingleGlobalTimeStep} - the same time step
for the entire domain and all species,
\\{\tt TimeStepMode=SpeciesGlobalTimeStep} - time step is different for
different species, but the same for the entire domain,
\\{\tt TimeStepMode=SingleLocalTimeStep} - time step is the same for all species, 
but differs within the domain,
\\{\tt TimeStepMode=SpeciesLocalTimeStep} - time step is different for different
species and differs within the domain.

\item {\bf ParticleWeightMode}
Defines the way the statistical weights of particles are defined, for are available:
\\{\tt  ParticleWeightMode=SingleGlobalParticleWeight},
\\{\tt  ParticleWeightMode=SpeciesGlobalParticleWeight},
\\{\tt  ParticleWeightMode=SingleLocalParticleWeight},
\\{\tt  ParticleWeightMode=SpeciesLocalParticleWeight}.

\item {\bf ParticleWeightCorrectionMode}
Switches ON/OFF.

\item {\bf ErrorLog}

Name of the file to write error information to.
\\{\tt ErrorLog=error.log}

\item {\bf Prefix}

\item {\bf DiagnosticStream}

\item {\bf OutputDirectory}

Name of the folder to write results to.
\\{\tt OutputDirectory=out}


\end{itemize}
